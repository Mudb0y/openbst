 * come back signed sixteen bit, one channel, at the rate bst_rate gives.

 * The tables the engine reads are compiled in, so nothing but this library
 * has to be present at run time. bst_open_image is there for a caller that
 * has an original binary and would rather read the tables out of it. */
