/* Frame generation: the three record streams the front end produces, turned
   into the sixteen-byte frames the lattice consumes.
 *
 * The three streams are read by three cursors that advance at different rates
 * and feed each other. Segments name diphone entries; expanding one appends
 * its records to a small ring and, in passing, fills in the durations of the
 * transition records that cover it. Transitions carry gain and pitch targets
 * and the spans over which to reach them. Intonation records carry the pitch
 * contour. A frame comes out when all three agree on how long the next one
 * lasts. */
